#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engneering involves development and maintenance of quality software systems by systematic application of engineering principles.
It is important in the Technology Indusry as it enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life for example in communication

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages for example C and Fortran.Early computers were programmed using machine language and later assembly language.
2.Establishment of Software Engineering that involved development of High level languages for code readability
3.The rise of structured programming for modular programming to improve software maintability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requrements.
Requirement Analysis: Identifying and documenting user expectations and system needs.

Design: Crafting both high-level and detailed plans for the software’s structure and user interface.

Implementation: Writing the actual code and developing the software as per the design guidelines.

Testing: Running different evaluations to verify that the software meets quality and functional standards.

Deployment: Delivering the completed software to users or customers.

Maintenance: Continuously improving, updating, and fixing issues in the software after release.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a linear, step-by-step approach, where each phase (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance) is completed before moving to the next. It is rigid, requires extensive documentation, and is best suited for projects with fixed requirements. Testing happens at the end, making it risky for changes.

In contrast, Agile is flexible and iterative, breaking the project into small cycles (sprints) with frequent updates and testing. It emphasizes customer feedback, allowing changes throughout the development process. Agile prioritizes working software over documentation and focuses on continuous improvement.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-write codes and implements Software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineering-Ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager-Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-Provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code eg VSCode
VCS-this is a tool for tracking chnages to surce code and coordinating work among team members eg Git
they enhace productivity and collaboration and code quality.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping Up with Rapid Tech Changes – New tools emerge constantly, making it hard to stay updated. Focus on core concepts, follow industry trends, and practice through real projects.

Debugging & Fixing Complex Bugs – Some issues take hours to resolve. Break the problem into smaller parts, use debugging tools, and take breaks to approach it with a fresh mind.

Managing Time & Avoiding Burnout – Deadlines and long hours can be overwhelming. Prioritize tasks, take breaks, and set boundaries to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration Testing-Testing Interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing-Testing the whole entire software system
Acceptance Testing-Prioritizes users needs and tests the software against user reqirements.
All this are critical and important as it helps to identify and fix defects early in the development stages leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting well-structured inputs to guide AI models in generating accurate and relevant responses. It involves refining queries, adding context, and experimenting with wording to achieve the best possible outcomes.

A well-designed prompt improves the precision of AI-generated responses, ensuring clearer and more useful results. It also streamlines interactions, reducing back-and-forth clarifications, which saves time and enhances efficiency. Additionally, prompt engineering allows users to tailor AI outputs to specific tasks, whether for writing, coding, or problem-solving.

By mastering this skill, users can maximize the potential of AI, making interactions more effective and seamless


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about coding.
 Improved Prompt: Can you break down the basics of Python for a beginner? Like its key features and where it's commonly used?
 The first one is too broad—AI could give a general, unfocused answer. The improved version makes it clear that you want beginner-friendly info, focuses on Python, and asks for key details like features and real-world applications. This way, you get a response that’s actually useful!
